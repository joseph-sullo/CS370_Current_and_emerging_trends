Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
I was tasked with completing the Q-learning section of the code in this repository. All code setting up matrices, defining rewards, etc. was provided.

Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
  What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
  Computer scientists, in terms of AI, try to find new and better ways for machines to mimic human intelligence to solve problems. This can have a profound impact
  on our ability to quickly solve problems in the future.
  
How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
  It's important to approach problems as logically as possible. A computer leaves no room for interpretation, it will perform exactly what it is programmed to do.
  This makes it important to think each problem out and come up with clear, logical steps for the computer to follow.
  
What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
  My ethical responsibilies to the end user are to aways keep their privacy, security, and user experience at the forefront of my development strategy.
  Ethical responsibilies to the organization are the same.
